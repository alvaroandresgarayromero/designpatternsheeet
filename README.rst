Introduction
=============

Design Pattern cheatsheet was created as a way to study and collect code snippets of the
various SOLID design principles.
This repository follows the Creational, Structural, and Behavioral software design components as a
baseline for the project structure.

Getting Started
================

This workspace utilizes Docker to create a containerized service with all the required
libraries and dependencies to run the C++ applications. To get started, follow the steps below

1. Install Docker:
    Verify that Docker and Docker-Compose are installed.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # this project used Docker version 20.10.5
        $ docker --version

        # this project used docker-compose version 1.29.1
        $ docker-compose --version

2. Build image, and run Docker container:
    This may take a couple of minutes during the first time

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Executes docker container
        $ sudo docker-compose up

        # Open a new terminal to verify the active docker container is running
        # Note the container ID as we will use it below to verify a C++ test
        # app is running within the container.
        $ sudo docker container ls
        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
        5976e1426a62   cpp_image_latest   "/usr/sbin/sshd -D -â€¦"   3 weeks ago   Up 14 minutes   127.0.0.1:2222->22/tcp   cpp_container_latest


3. Running C++ application with the CLI:
    The instructions below shows you how to run the
    C++ application within the docker container through its
    command line interface (CLI)

    Enter Docker Container

    .. code-block:: bash

        # the numbers on root@**** is your unique Container ID
        $ sudo docker exec -it cpp_container_latest /bin/bash
        root@5976e1426a62:/app#

    Generate the build files from the test workspace.
    Note that each workspace will have their own CMakeLists.txt to keep them independent.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # the test workspace is in the hello_world directory
        root@5976e1426a62:/app# cd hello_world/
        root@5976e1426a62:/app/hello_world# cmake -S . -B out

    Generate the executable file. The executable file will be named "build"

    .. code-block:: bash

        root@5976e1426a62:/app/hello_world# cd out/
        root@5976e1426a62:/app/hello_world/out# make

    Run the executable file.

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Docker ID will printed since application is been
        # executed from the Docker Container with ID 5976e1426a62
        root@5976e1426a62:/app/hello_world/out# ./build
        Hello from 5976e1426a62

3. Running C++ with an IDE
    The instructions below shows you how to run the
    C++ application within the docker container from your host computer IDE.

    - Option 1: Some IDEs have Docker support. Check their documentation on how to connect to the container.
    - Option 2: Some IDEs don't have Docker support, but have remote host SSH connection support.
        - This container has exposed SSH Port 22 to Port 2222 for the host to connect to the container, (see docker-compose.yml for the port, and DockerFile for the user credentials).
        - As of 07/12/2021, remote host connection with Clion IDE works (see their documentation on how to connect to remote host: https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/01/using-docker-with-clion/#creating-a-docker-container-for-use-with-clion)

    Build and run the test application to verify that the host computer IDE is running the C++ application
    within the Docker Container. The output should be the active Docker Container ID

    .. code-block:: bash

        # test application path: .../hello_world/main.cpp

        # Docker ID will printed since application is been
        # executed from the Docker Container with ID 5976e1426a62
        Hello from 5976e1426a62
