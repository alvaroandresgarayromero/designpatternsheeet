/* An analogy for adapater design pattern is to power outlets around the world.
 * There are different voltages, and connectors. So we need an adapater to interface with our
 * electronics.
 *
 * Adapater design pattern is the construct of an interface that
 * adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y
 *
 *   INTERFACE X ---> ADAPATER INTERFACE ---> INTERFACE Y
